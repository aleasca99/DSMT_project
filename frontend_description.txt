General Overview

The frontend is implemented using JSP files to create web application pages, hosted on a Tomcat Server.
Each page communicates with the backend node through a servlet, which sends HTTP requests to the REST API
provided by the backend node. 
Each servlet is responsible for retrieving the data provided by the user, sending it to the API via a POST 
or GET request, and then waiting for and displaying the response to the user.

Homepage

When the user accesses the web application, they are presented with the login page. 
The login process is handled through a form linked to the corresponding servlet, which sends a POST request 
to the API and waits for a response from the backend node. 
If the login is successful, the backend node generates a response, and the user is redirected to the user area. 
Otherwise, the servlet returns an error message that is displayed to the user.
The same process applies to user registration.

User Area

When the user accesses the user area, the page communicates with the backend node via a GET request through a servlet. 
This request retrieves all information about events the user has participated in, is currently participating in, or has created. 
The retrieved data is then displayed in a tabular format.
Additionally, from this page, the user can add constraints or create a new event.

Event Management

Similar to the login and registration processes, event creation involves sending a POST request to the backend node. 
Once the event data is saved, the backend returns the eventId to the servlet, which then displays it to the user.
If a user knows an eventId—either because they created the event or received it from another source—they 
can add constraints to that event. Constraints are expressed in the format YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm with a lower bound and an upper bound, 
representing the time range in which the user is available to participate. 
These constraints are included in the request body as a list of strings formatted as lower_bound,upper_bound.
Once a user has submitted their availability, they will be able to view the event in the user area table. After the event's deadline has passed, the user will be able to see the final event result, also formatted as lower_bound,upper_bound, where each boundary is a string in the format YYYY-MM-DD.
